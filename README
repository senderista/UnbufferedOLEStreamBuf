This provides a subclass of std::streambuf that wraps a COM IStream, so you can use an IStream with any C++ code that uses iostreams or the STL algorithms with a streambuf_iterator. It does no internal buffering whatsoever (I'd be happy to change this if someone needs it).

This code is entirely within the public domain. It may be used for any purpose whatsoever, with no attribution required.
